# Key Generator For Gui
Just change the direct path to the images you want to goto.


*How to use*


1.) Open Automation.py in notepad


2.) Change the directories to the images you create
for the application you want to use, such as ubisoft


Then run the code and make sure the application is clicked.
If you unclick from the application, the variables will be set to none.
This stops the application but still runs in a loop in the background in case you want to resume.
It's a work in progress and its still a work in progress from a beginner.

### Code you run ###
auto = Automation()
auto.automate()
